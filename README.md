# Sentimental Analysis on IMDB Dataset

Project Description
This project performs sentimental analysis on the IMDB dataset using various machine learning models. The models used include Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost. The project preprocesses the text data, trains the models, evaluates their performance, and provides a function to predict the sentiment of custom reviews.

Installation Instructions
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
